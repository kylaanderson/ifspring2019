		<h1>Brent's Feedback</h1>
		<p> 
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Is the design beautiful/striking/remarkable?</strong><br><br>The box is least visible in the second one, which is the most successful. You might consider scaling up the font size to draw more attention to the words.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Does the design aesthetic relate to the concept?</strong><br><br>Yes, the font choice and positioning seems fitting (although you could try putting the text at the top left on the first card just to see if it works better).</li><br>
				<li><strong>Do the imagery and design choices support the text?</strong><br><br>Yes</li><br>
				<li><strong>Is the aesthetic consistent</strong><br><br>Yes</li><br>
				<li><strong>Is the aesthetic driving the concept, or vice-versa?</strong><br><br>The concept drives the aesthetic.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Is it legible?</strong><br><br>Yes.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Are type size/color/face/treatment choices helping or hurting?</strong><br><br>The first postcard could use black type for more contrast. Other than scale (already mentioned) they work well. The larger boxes break off of the image plane, though. I’m not sure that was intentional.</li><br>
				<li><strong>What are the design’s visual priorities?</strong><br><br>Image reads fast, text has contrast so it’s readable.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Are design elements working in contrast, complement, or conflict?</strong><br><br>Aside from the text boxes breaking the picture plane, the design elements work. </li><br>
				<li><strong>What elements do you consider foreground? Background?</strong><br><br>Foreground: text. Background: images.</li><br>
				<li><strong>How will the design accommodate variability in browser width?</strong><br><br>The entire picture shrinks. You might consider different crops to accommodate browser width. </li><br>
				<li><strong>Is transparency, if used, used appropriately?</strong><br><br>Transparency only used to make text boxes (which could be eliminated with drop shadows and/or a screen or gradient over the whole image to add contrast)</li><br>
				<li><strong>What happens at all of the sizes in between the desktop and mobile versions that have been provided?</strong><br><br>The text boxes get wider. The images get bigger.</li><br>
				<li><strong>At what point does text collide with imagery? At what point does contrast affect legibility?</strong><br><br>There is no issue with contrast due to the boxes, but the text should probably scale with the image.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Are images presented with sufficient resolution, and without unintentional distortion or compression artifacts?</strong><br><br>The first image is a little blurrier than the others, but otherwise good.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Have image edges all been considered and managed?</strong><br><br>Yes.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Will elements such as fonts transfer as intended to the browser environment?</strong><br><br>The font is just “italic” so it should transfer to all browsers.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Can you build it?</strong><br><br>I think so, yes.</li><br>
