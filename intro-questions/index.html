		<h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>My name is Kyla Anderson. I am a sophomore majoring in Communication Design.</li><br>
			<li>I am interested in learning about coding and web design (and this class is also a requirement for my major), so I decided to take this class. </li><br>
			<li>I have no experience with coding of any form.</li><br>
			<li>I hope to learn how to design a cool website with code, and maybe learn the basics of a couple types of code.</li><br>
			<li>I imagine that designing for a screen will be much more mathematical and technical than designing for paper.</li><br>
			<li>I think <a href="https://www.mixbook.com/?source=montage&utm_source=montage">Mixbook Photo Co.</a> is an effective design. The mixture of fonts and colors are pleasing to the eye, everything is clean and seemingly easy to find, and photos and buttons send clear signals and ideas to the viewer.</li><br>
			<li>I believe that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a> website exemplifies effective communication because even though it is not particularly visually interesting, it has a clear division between topics the way the site is designed (using horizontal rules), and titles vs. paragraphs are, again, clearly distinguishable. In short, it is easy to navigate, clean, and legible. </li><br>
			<li>I think the <a href="https://www.etq-amsterdam.com">ETQ</a> website works well because it is easy to navagate, has visually pleasing colors and photos, and is clear in communication.</li>
