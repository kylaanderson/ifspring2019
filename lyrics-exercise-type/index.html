		<h1>Rewrite the Stars</h1>
		<h2 >(from The Greatest Showman)</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="lavender">You know I want you</span>
			<br>It's not a secret I try to hide
			<br><span class="lavender">I know you want me</span>
			<br>So <span class="plum">don't keep saying our hands are tied</span>
			<br>You claim it's not in the cards
			<br>Fate is pulling you miles away
			<br>And out of reach from me
			<br>But you're here in my heart
			<br>So <span class="lavender">who can stop me if I decide</span>
			<br>That you're my destiny?


			<br><br><span class="title">What if we rewrite the stars?</span>
			<br>Say you were made to be mine
			<br><span class="lavender">Nothing could keep us apart</span>
			<br>You'd be the one I was meant to find
			<br>It's up to you, and it's up to me
			<br>No one can say what we get to be
			<br>So why don't we rewrite the stars?
			<br>Maybe the world could be ours
			<br>Tonight


			<br><br>You think it's easy
			<br>You think I don't want to run to you
			<br><span class="lavender">But there are mountains</span>
			<br>And there are doors that we can't walk through
			<br>I know you're wondering why
			<br>Because we're able to be
			<br>Just you and me
			<br>Within these walls
			<br>But when we go outside
			<br><span class="lavender">You're going to wake up and see that it was hopeless after all</span>


			<br><br><span class="title">No one can rewrite the stars</span>
			<br>How can you say you'll be mine?
			<br>Everything keeps us apart
			<br>And <span class="lavender">I'm not the one you were meant to find</span>
			<br>It's not up to you
			<br>It's not up to me
			<br>When everyone tells us what we can be
			<br>How can we rewrite the stars?
			<br>Say that the world can be ours
			<br>Tonight


			<br><br>All I want is to fly with you
			<br>All I want is to fall with you
			<br>So just give me all of you
			<br><span class="white">It feels impossible(it's not impossible)</span>
			<br><span class= "khaki">Is it impossible?</span>
			<br><span class="gold">Say that it's possible</span>


			<br><br><span class="title">How do we rewrite the stars?
			<br>Say you were made to be mine?
			<br><span class="gold">Nothing can keep us apart
			<br>'Cause you are the one I was meant to find</span>
			<br><span class="title">It's up to you</span>
			<br>And it's up to me
			<br>No one can say what we get to be
			<br>And <span class="gold">why don't we rewrite the stars?</span>
			<br>Changing the world to be ours</span><br>


			<br><br><span class="khakib">You know I want you<br></span>
			<br><span id="secret">It's not a secret I try to hide</span><br>
			<br>But I can't have you<br>
			<br><span id="end">We're bound to break and my hands are tied</p></span>
