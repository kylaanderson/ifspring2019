				<h5>Episode 1– SugarWood</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Original Release Date: July 21, 2017</p>
					<p class="text" class="episode">Marty Byrde and his partner Bruce are Chicago-based financial advisers who launder money for a Mexican drug cartel. Bruce and the trucking company owners who move the cash skim $8 million, which causes their cartel contact Del to kill Bruce, Bruce's fiancée Liz, and the father-son trucking company owners. To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary "Sugarwood" Silverberg. She follows his advice to leave Marty and take their two children and as much money as she can secure, which causes Del to have Silverberg killed as a warning to Wendy to keep the family together.</p>
				<h5>Episode 2– Blue Cat</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Original Release Date: July 21, 2017</p>
					<p class="text">Wendy, Marty and their two children arrive in the Ozarks and begin to meet local residents, including several members of the Langmore family who work at the hotel where they are staying. Marty attempts to find local businesses he can invest in so that he can commence money laundering for the cartel, while Wendy goes house hunting. Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved. Marty considers committing suicide so Wendy can collect his life insurance and flee with the children, but changes his mind after he realizes that the Blue Cat inn and restaurant might be a suitable place to invest in.</p>
				<h5>Episode 3– My Dripping Sleep</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Original Release Date: July 21, 2017</p>
					<p class="text">The Byrdes move into a lakefront house while Buddy, the terminally ill homeowner, moves to the basement. FBI Agent Trevor Evans, Roy's former boyfriend, follows Roy's instructions to approach the Byrdes, who are not intimidated and continue maintaining their innocence. The Byrdes are made aware that while skimming money, Bruce was also an FBI informant. Trevor sees that Roy is becoming obsessed, foretelling continued problems for the Byrdes. Charlotte and Jonah are told the real reason for their move to the Ozarks, and Jonah does online research to learn more about the cartel. Wendy gets a job as an advance person and "stager" for the real estate broker she dealt with when buying Buddy's house. Charlotte's job interview does not end well after she spots Wyatt outside the store and punches him in retaliation for his ruse at the hotel. Marty begins activities at the Blue Cat, despite the suspicions of Rachel, the primary owner. Ruth uses her knowledge of the Byrdes' cash to persuade Marty to hire her as a dishwasher at the Blue Cat, and informs her cousins and uncles that her plan is to learn Marty's money laundering operation, and then kill him and take the money.</p>
				<h5>Episode 4– Tonight We Improvise</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Original Release Date: July 21, 2017</p>
					<p class="text">Marty gathers information on Lickety Splitz, a money-losing strip club; turned away by the owner previously, he still intends to control it so he can use it for money laundering. Jonah finds the carcass of a coyote and cuts it open, causing his parents to worry it is a sign of future troubles. They are relieved to find that he was only studying the vultures that came to feed. Marty hires Ruth to break into the Lickety Splitz safe. Working undercover, Roy watches Marty at the Blue Cat, and develops an interest in Russ Langmore, Wyatt's father and Ruth's uncle. Bobby Dean, the owner of Lickety Splitz, is arrested because of Ruth's plan, and Marty gains access to the safe. He posts Bobby's bail and uses the information from the safe to force Bobby to sell the club. Jacob and Darlene Snell are revealed as major heroin dealers, for whom Bobby was laundering money. They kill Bobby as retaliation for losing the club, and to keep their drug business secret. Marty shares business secrets with Jonah, including how to make new cash used in drug transactions look old so it can be mixed with cash from legitimate business before being deposited at the bank.</p>
				<h5>Episode 5– Ruling Days</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Original Release Date: July 21, 2017</p>
					<p class="text">Bobby's body turns up at the Byrdes' boat dock, which they unconvincingly explain away as an accident. Shown copies of the sale documents for the strip club, the sheriff realizes he has no evidence the Byrdes had a motive to kill Bobby, and takes no further action. Jacob Snell attempts to persuade Marty to launder money for him at Lickety Splitz. Marty sees Mason Young, the local pastor, holding boat-based Sunday services on the lake, and realizes that building Mason a church could present an opportunity to launder money. Marty asks Ruth to run the strip club over the Fourth of July weekend, which leads to him hiring her as the full time manager. She betters Bobby's management with actions, including hiring new staff, that turn Lickety Splitz into a moneymaker. Roy continues to use Russ as a fishing guide, and attempts to kiss him, provoking a violent reaction. Ruth continues to follow her incarcerated father Cade's advice to learn more about Marty's money laundering, and discovers the hiding place where he stashed the $8 million he brought from Chicago.</p>
				<h5>Episode 6– Book of Ruth</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Original Release Date: July 21, 2017</p>

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the $8 million he brought from Chicago, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood. She then discovers the video Marty's private investigator made, which causes an angry confrontation. Charlotte works at the Blue Cat, and turns down Wyatt's "anti-tourists" party invitation to go with Zach, a tourist from Chicago. She drinks with Zach and loses her virginity, and Zach departs for Chicago the next day without saying goodbye, prompting Wyatt to tell her the tourists always leave, and she is now "one of us", i.e. a permanent local resident. Russ acknowledges he is gay, and begins a sexual relationship with Roy. Ruth and Russ devise a plan to kill Marty at Cade's instigation. Russ tells Roy, who secretly intervenes. Wendy opens Del's package, and Marty and she recognize the contents as a warning to speed up the money laundering.</p>

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead. After returning home, Charlotte goes for a night swim. Ignoring Marty's advice to stay near the shore, she swims far into the lake.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to waterboarding interrogation.

Mason returns, hoping the bones include Grace's remains, and volunteers Zeke for DNA testing.

Instead, Ruth tells Wyatt, who drives away in anger. Angry that Cade attacked Charlotte while trying to find Marty's money, Wendy offers him $500,000 to leave town. He takes it and drives away, but the payoff is a ruse and a Navarro associate kills him. At the casino's opening ceremony, Helen tells the Byrdes she is returning to Chicago. Wendy tells Marty the family is not fleeing to the Gold Coast because it is safer to stay. Frank blows up Marty's office as a warning to solve the union versus non-union labor issue.</p>

				<h3 class="end">Critical Response<h3>
					<h4>Season 1</h4>
						<p class="text">On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 69% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 6.84/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Ozark hasn't yet reached the same level as the classic crime dramas to which it will inevitably be compared, but its satisfyingly complex plot – and a gripping performance from Jason Bateman – suggest greater potential." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<br><br>
						Brian Lowry of CNN wrote, "While the fish-out-of-water concept is one of TV's oldest, Ozark carves out its own path with clever twists—including a late-in-the-run flashback explaining how the cartel came into his life—and the sheer strength of the performances." TV critic Sonia Saraiya of Variety wrote that Ozark is "smart, well-crafted, and says something," and that the series "comes together under Bateman's disarming and deceptively complex performance as Marty." Tim Dowling of The Guardian wrote "Laura Linney is, as ever, magnificent".<br><br>
						Critics compared Ozark positively to Breaking Bad, both of which involve a seemingly normal protagonist suddenly immersed in a world of crime. Nick Hanover wrote in Film Daily, "Once you get past the surface similarities, Ozark shines as something special and inventive, an intense crime opera where the scenery is as much the star as anyone in the cast."</p>
					<h4>Season 2</h4>
						<p class="text">On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season has an approval rating of 72% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.54/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Engaging and entertaining – if not particularly challenging – Ozark's descent into darker waters is kept afloat by another superb turn from Laura Linney." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<br><br>
						Alison Foreman of Mashable noted how the female characters are not just "emotional fodder" for the male characters, stating "Season 2 of Netflix's Ozark, however, champions female stories through all 10 of its episodes with an array of women that rivals the ensemble complexity of HBO's The Sopranos."</p>
